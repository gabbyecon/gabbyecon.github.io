Persona:

Courtney is a sophomore in college (20 yrs old) and is your typical 'girly-girl'. She lives and breathes for her sorority sisters, takes one million pictures at every function she goes to, and spends hours editing her Instagram photos so that they match her theme for her feed. She can't go a day without her skinny mocha frappaccino, no whip cream, and she has to get her acrylic nails done every three weeks. While she may seem artificial and overly confident on the outside, on the inside, Courtney is tired of putting on the show of a perfectionist. She secretly loves junk food and just wants to dive into a new book. She loves to exercise, but feels like its too much effort sometimes.
